My plan for using Kali is as follows:
I have downloaded the Carleton
REMOTELAB software which I have
tested by using it for this assignment
(since the terminal on my personal Mac
was not working for some reason). And,
because i am on campus, I will be utilizing
the Olin labs. I will not be downloading
Kali onto my personal Mac.

My only concern is that my terminal window
does not work, I asked multiple people and
even went to the Lab Assistant and still
nothing has worked. My final test was
updating my computer software, but that
did nothing.
